<P> Delete a file or smart contract - can only be done with a Hedera admin multisig. When it is deleted, it immediately disappears from the system as seen by the user, but is still stored internally until the expiration time, at which time it is truly and permanently deleted. Until that time, it can be undeleted by the Hedera admin multisig. When a smart contract is deleted, the cryptocurrency account within it continues to exist, and is not affected by the expiration time here. </P>

Until that time, it can be undeleted by the Hedera admin multisig. When a smart contract is deleted, the cryptocurrency account within it continues to exist, and is not affected by the expiration time here. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<H3 id="TransactionID"><span class="BigBadge">Message</span>TransactionID</H3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> A Key can be a public key from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. And similarly for RSA and ECDSA.</P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it.

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Key can be a public key from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. And similarly for RSA and ECDSA.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it.

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Transfer cryptocurrency from some accounts to other accounts. The accounts list can contain up to 10 accounts. The amounts list must be the same length as the accounts list. Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> A Key can be a public key from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. And similarly for RSA and ECDSA.</P>

<P> Attach the given hash to the given account. The hash can be deleted by the keys used to transfer money from the account. The hash can also be deleted by any one of the deleteKeys (where that one may itself be a threshold key made up of multiple keys). Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

Each of them must reach its threshold when signing the transaction, to attach this claim to this account. At least one of them must reach its threshold to delete this Claim from this account. This is intended to provide a revocation service: all the authorities agree to attach the hash, to attest to the fact that the credential or certificate is valid. Any one of the authorities can later delete the hash, to indicate that the credential has been revoked. In this way, any client can prove to a third party that any particular account has certain credentials, or to identity facts proved about it, and that none of them have been revoked yet. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged.

<P> Change properties for the given account. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). The receiverSigRequired boolean field cannot be changed; it is immutable. This transaction must be signed by the existing key for this account. If the transaction is changing the key field, then the transaction must be signed by both the old key (from before the change) and the new key. The old key must sign for security. The new key must sign as a safeguard to avoid accidentally changing to an invalid key, and then having no way to recover. When extending the expiration date, the cost is affected by the size of the list of attached claims, and of the keys associated with the claims and the account. </P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free.

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it.

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Attach the given hash to the given account. The hash can be deleted by the keys used to transfer money from the account. The hash can also be deleted by any one of the deleteKeys (where that one may itself be a threshold key made up of multiple keys). Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

The hash can also be deleted by any one of the deleteKeys (where that one may itself be a threshold key made up of multiple keys). Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Until that time, it can be undeleted by the Hedera admin multisig.

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Transfer cryptocurrency from some accounts to other accounts. The accounts list can contain up to 10 accounts. The amounts list must be the same length as the accounts list. Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free.

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged.

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> Get all of the information about a file, except for its contents. When a file expires, it no longer exists, and there will be no info about it, and the fileInfo field will be blank. If a transaction or smart contract deletes the file, but it has not yet expired, then the fileInfo field will be non-empty, the deleted field will be true, its size will be 0, and its contents will be empty. Note that each file has a FileID, but does not have a filename. </P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it.

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> When the node receives a transaction from a client, it performs a precheck, to see if if the transaction is correctly formed, and if the account has sufficient cryptocurrency to pay the transaction fee. If it passes the precheck, then the node will send it to the network for processing.  The node will always reply to a transaction with the TransactionResponse, which indicates whether it passed the precheck, or why it failed. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Transfer cryptocurrency from some accounts to other accounts. The accounts list can contain up to 10 accounts. The amounts list must be the same length as the accounts list. Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

It is available for a Record, but not a receipt. It is available for the information in each kind of *GetInfo request. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged.

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Each of them must reach its threshold when signing the transaction, to attach this claim to this account. At least one of them must reach its threshold to delete this Claim from this account. This is intended to provide a revocation service: all the authorities agree to attach the hash, to attest to the fact that the credential or certificate is valid. Any one of the authorities can later delete the hash, to indicate that the credential has been revoked. In this way, any client can prove to a third party that any particular account has certain credentials, or to identity facts proved about it, and that none of them have been revoked yet. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

If the transaction is changing the key field, then the transaction must be signed by both the old key (from before the change) and the new key. The old key must sign for security. The new key must sign as a safeguard to avoid accidentally changing to an invalid key, and then having no way to recover. When extending the expiration date, the cost is affected by the size of the list of attached claims, and of the keys associated with the claims and the account. </P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

The hash can also be deleted by any one of the deleteKeys (where that one may itself be a threshold key made up of multiple keys). Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Until that time, it can be undeleted by the Hedera admin multisig.

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Transfer cryptocurrency from some accounts to other accounts. The accounts list can contain up to 10 accounts. The amounts list must be the same length as the accounts list. Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it.

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Transfer cryptocurrency from some accounts to other accounts. The accounts list can contain up to 10 accounts. The amounts list must be the same length as the accounts list. Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response.

But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it.

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Transfer cryptocurrency from some accounts to other accounts. The accounts list can contain up to 10 accounts. The amounts list must be the same length as the accounts list. Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Each of them must reach its threshold when signing the transaction, to attach this claim to this account. At least one of them must reach its threshold to delete this Claim from this account. This is intended to provide a revocation service: all the authorities agree to attach the hash, to attest to the fact that the credential or certificate is valid. Any one of the authorities can later delete the hash, to indicate that the credential has been revoked. In this way, any client can prove to a third party that any particular account has certain credentials, or to identity facts proved about it, and that none of them have been revoked yet. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD colspan=3>
<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged.

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Attach the given hash to the given account. The hash can be deleted by the keys used to transfer money from the account. The hash can also be deleted by any one of the deleteKeys (where that one may itself be a threshold key made up of multiple keys). Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Transfer cryptocurrency from some accounts to other accounts. The accounts list can contain up to 10 accounts. The amounts list must be the same length as the accounts list. Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it.

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged.

<P> Change properties for the given account. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). The receiverSigRequired boolean field cannot be changed; it is immutable. This transaction must be signed by the existing key for this account. If the transaction is changing the key field, then the transaction must be signed by both the old key (from before the change) and the new key. The old key must sign for security. The new key must sign as a safeguard to avoid accidentally changing to an invalid key, and then having no way to recover. When extending the expiration date, the cost is affected by the size of the list of attached claims, and of the keys associated with the claims and the account. </P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each negative amount is withdrawn from the corresponding account (a sender), and each positive one is added to the corresponding account (a receiver). The amounts list must sum to zero. Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

<P> Each shard has a nonnegative shard number. Each realm within a given shard has a nonnegative realm number (that number might be reused in other shards). And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

<P> Attach the given hash to the given account. The hash can be deleted by the keys used to transfer money from the account. The hash can also be deleted by any one of the deleteKeys (where that one may itself be a threshold key made up of multiple keys). Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true. The signatures are in the same order as the accounts, skipping those accounts that don't need a signature. </P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> Get the record for a transaction. If the transaction requested a record, then the record lasts for one hour, and a state proof is available for it. If the transaction created an account, file, or smart contract instance, then the record will contain the ID for what it created. If the transaction called a smart contract function, then the record contains the result of that call. If the transaction was a cryptocurrency transfer, then the record includes the TransferList which gives the details of that transfer. If the transaction didn't return anything that should be in the record, then the results field will be set to nothing. </P>

<P> Each query from the client to the node will contain the QueryHeader, which gives the requested response type, and includes a payment for the response. It will sometimes leave payment blank: it is blank for TransactionGetReceiptQuery. It can also be left blank when the responseType is costAnswer or costAnswerStateProof. But it needs to be filled in for all other cases. The idea is that an answer that is only a few bytes (or that was paid for earlier) can be given for free. But if the answer is something that requires many bytes or much computation (like a state proof), then it should be paid for. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

And each account, file, and smart contract instance within a given realm has a nonnegative number (which might be reused in other realms). Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> Modify a smart contract instance to have the given parameter values. Any null field is ignored (left unchanged). If only the contractInstanceExpirationTime is being modified, then no signature is needed on this transaction other than for the account paying for the transaction itself. But if any of the other fields are being modified, then it must be signed by the adminKey. The use of adminKey is not currently supported in this API, but in the future will be implemented to allow these fields to be modified, and also to make modifications to the state of the instance. If the contract is created with no admin key, then none of the fields can be changed that need an admin signature, and therefore no admin key can ever be added. So if there is no admin key, then things like the bytecode are immutable. But if there is an admin key, then they can be changed. For example, the admin key might be a threshold key, which requires 3 of 5 binding arbitration judges to agree before the bytecode can be changed. This can be used to add flexibility to the mangement of smart contract behavior. But this is optional. If the smart contract is created without an admin key, then such a key can never be added, and its bytecode will be immutable. </P>

Therefore, this acts as a revocation service for claims about the account. External authorities may issue certificates or credentials of some kind that make a claim about this account. The account owner can then attach a hash of that claim to the account. The transaction that adds the claim will be signed by the owner of the account, and also by all the authorities that are attesting to the truth of that claim. If the claim ever ceases to be true, such as when a certificate is revoked, then any one of the listed authorities has the ability to delete it. The account owner also has the ability to delete it at any time.</P>

<P> Create a new account. After the account is created, the AccountID for it is in the receipt, or can be retrieved with a GetByKey query, or by asking for a Record of the transaction to be created, and retrieving that. The account can then automatically generate records for large transfers into it or out of it, which each last for 24 hours. Records are generated for any transfer that exceeds the thresholds given here. This account is charged cryptocurrency for each record generated, so the thresholds are useful for limiting Record generation to happen only for large transactions. The Key field is the key used to sign transactions for this account. If the account has receiverSigRequired set to true, then all cryptocurrency transfers must be signed by this account's key, both for transfers in and out. If it is false, then only transfers out have to be signed by it. When the account is created, the payer account is charged enough hbars so that the new account will not expire for the next autoRenewPeriod seconds. When it reaches the expiration time, the new account will then be automatically charged to renew for another autoRenewPeriod seconds. If it does not have enough hbars to renew for that long, then the remaining hbars are used to extend its expiration as long as possible. If it is has a zero balance when it expires, then it is deleted. This transaction must be signed by the payer account. If receiverSigRequired is false, then the transaction does not have to be signed by the keys in the keys field. If it is true, then it must be signed by them, in addition to the keys of the payer account.</P>

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

Each amount is a number of tinyBars (there are 100,000,000 tinyBars in one Hbar). If any sender account fails to have sufficient hbars to do the withdrawal, then the entire transaction fails, and none of those transfers occur, though the transaction fee is still charged. This transaction must be signed by the keys for all the sending accounts, and for any receiving accounts that have receiverSigRequired == true.

Every account, file, and smart contract instance is within exactly one realm. So a FileID is a triplet of numbers, like 0.1.2 for entity number 2 within realm 1  within shard 0.  Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning numbers,  so if there is a file with ID 0.1.2, then there won't be an account or smart  contract instance with ID 0.1.2.</P>

<P> A Signature corresponding to a Key. It is a sequence of bytes holding a public key signature from one of the three supported systems (ed25519, RSA-3072,  ECDSA with p384). Or, it can be a list of signatures corresponding to a single threshold key. Or, it can be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is authorized to act as if it had a key. If an account has an ed25519 key associated with it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. If it has a smart contract ID associated with it, then that smart contract is allowed to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. The smart contract doesn't actually have a key, and  doesn't actually sign a transaction. But it's as if a virtual transaction were created, and the smart contract signed it with a private key. A key can also be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements (this nesting is not supported in the currently, but will be supported in a future version of API). If a Signature message is missing the "signature" field, then this is considered to be a null signature. That is useful in cases such as threshold signatures, where some of the signatures can be null.</P>

<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<TD colspan=3>
<P> The ID for a transaction. This is used for retrieving receipts and records for a transaction, for appending to a file right after creating it, for instantiating a smart contract with bytecode in a file just created, and internally by the network for detecting when duplicate transactions are submitted. A user might get a transaction processed faster by submitting it to N nodes, each with a different node account, but all with the same TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other transactions will not take effect. So this could make the transaction take effect faster, if any given node might be slow. However, the full transaction fee is charged for each transaction, so the total fee is N times as much if the transaction is sent to N nodes. </P>

<P> When the node receives a transaction from a client, it performs a precheck, to see if if the transaction is correctly formed, and if the account has sufficient cryptocurrency to pay the transaction fee. If it passes the precheck, then the node will send it to the network for processing.  The node will always reply to a transaction with the TransactionResponse, which indicates whether it passed the precheck, or why it failed. </P>

<H3 id="TransactionResponse"><span class="BigBadge">Message</span>TransactionResponse</H3>
<P> When the client sends the node a transaction of any kind, the node replies with this, which simply says that the transaction passed the precheck (so the node will submit it to the network) or it failed (so it won't). To learn the consensus result, the client should later obtain a receipt (free), or can buy a more detailed record (not free). </P>
